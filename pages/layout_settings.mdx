# Understanding Layout Section 

Prime comes with a simple, well defined layout. You can enable/disable most of the blog features from layout.

## License

Add your license code on this section. You will be prompt with one upon purchase.

## Notification Bar

Display custom call to action buttons or important information to your theme. Default setting is `sticky`.

## Header 

Set your company image or text logo under Header Logo section. You can also set navigation menus. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The dropdown menus cannot be controlled from layout. Please refer to Theme Customization.
</Callout>

## Hero Header 

Easily change the text of hero header from layout. You can also setup **Popular Post Widget** from this section. *Please note, if you are highly concerned about pagespeed (though the page speed hits 90+ with popular post thumbnails), we recommend disabling 'Display Thumbnails'.*

## Ads 

Ads can be directly embedded into your theme from layout. Look for **highlighted Ads Options** and insert your code there. We offer 7 ads location from Layout.

<!-- Change `YOUR_LABEL_NAME` with your label name -->
<!-- It is important to select a label that has at least 4 published contents -->
<script type="more-lazyscript" src="/feeds/posts/summary/-/YOUR_LABEL_NAME?published&amp;alt=json-in-script&amp;callback=labelthumbs" ></script>
```

## Footer 

Customize footer menus, social links and about us section easily from layout. *Please note: You do not need to insert form action link for email subscription, it is auto configured using our addon.* 

## Addons 

<Steps>

### Insert your email subscription link 

Paste your email provider action link and **Subscribe** widget will be auto configured. 

### Reading Progress bar 

Display a beautiful reading progress bar at the top of page. 

### PrismJS Syntax Highlighter 

By default, we implement simple syntax highlighter, however, if you share a lot of codes enable this option for better configuration. We accept `CSS`, `HTML`, `JS` and `XML` highlights. 

### Sticky Header 

Enable this feature to make header sticky. Please note, **notification bar** does not stay sticky upon activating this option.

### Cookies consent 

Display a simple cookies consent bar.

### Anti ad-blocker 

Unlike other anti adblocker, we display a portion of our post body and show ad block detected message. 

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You might notice a request to `adsbygoogle.js` after enabling this plugin and it is normal, since we injecting that code and testing if ad blocker blocks the request.
</Callout>

### Automatic TOC 

Activate this to automatically add a table of contents to each posts with more than 2 heading tags.
