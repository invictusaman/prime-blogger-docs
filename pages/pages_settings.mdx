## Contact Forms

We offer custom built forms for about, contact and contribute pages. However, you need to modify `action` value and `field` value separately for form to work. You can follow this simple guide that covers [how you can set custom contact forms with Google sheets](https://www.twistblogg.com/2022/09/fix-blogger-contact-form-not-sending.html).

## Individual Author Pages 

<Steps>

### Setting Correct URL

When you set individual author pages, it is important that you set correct url. If you go to any post, you will notice, there is a button that displays following message: **Explore more articles by AUTHOR_NAME**. 

The `AUTHOR_NAME` is auto fetched using javascript and it creates a `href` of following format --

```html
www.example.com/p/author-your-name.html
```

Therefore, when you create a page in your blogger for each author, please write the title "**Author YOUR_NAME**". That way, a valid page address is generated. 

Examples: `Author Twistblogg`, `Author Aman Bhattarai`, `Author Prime Theme` and so on...

### Setting Correct Author name

Author names are case sensitive. Therefore, an author with name `Aman Bhattarai` won't match with `Aman bhattarai`.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If your blog contains articles by author who deleted his/her blogger profile, set author name to `Unknown`.
</Callout>

### Limiting Number of Articles Displayed

When you pass your `<script>`, use `max-results=no_of_articles`. By default, it displays first 25 articles.

### Blogs with more than 200 articles

We can call maximum 200 articles in a single script. If your blog contains more than 200 articles, you can set `start-index` to start after 200 articles.

```html
<script src='.....?start-index=200&max-results=200.....'></script>
```

</Steps>
